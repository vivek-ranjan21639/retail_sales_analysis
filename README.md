## Project Description

**Name of the project:** retail_sales_analysis  
**Database:** `retail_sales_analysis`

This project explores retail sales data and performs exploratory data analysis and data cleaning. Analysis on the cleaned data has also been performed to see various business insights. The purpose of the project is to showcase my skill in SQL and moreover my aptitude to ask the right and in-depth business questions. Even though the database contains only one data table titled 'retail_sales', some of the questions asked are complex and require the application of advanced SQL concepts. For any user who wants to get inspired and learn or perform similar analysis on this data, they can clone it and execute the same code or modify as per their understanding. In this reference, it is mentioned that the code here is written in PostgreSQL. Therefore, it is suggested that users may check the variability in the code if they are using any other platform.

## Objective:
1. **Setting up Database:** To set up a database for a retail sales business and populate it with data.
2. **Data Cleaning:** To clean data on retail sales to make it analysis-ready. 
3. **Perform basic EDA:**  Perform basic EDA to explore the data
4. **Data Analysis:** To analyse the data and get business insights


## Findings of this project
This project focuses on various business insights like revenue from different product categories, the 
highest selling product, gender led sales differences in different product categories,
temporal sales trend etc. Some complex insights have also been drawn, like the time interval when the 
highest no. of orders are placed, seasonality of the product sales etc. 
Some of the insights answering these business questions are as follows:
- Electronics is the highest-selling product in terms of quantity and generates the highest revenue among the three product categories, followed by clothing and beauty.
- The average age of the customer who placed orders in the beauty category is 40 years. This insight is interesting as the common perception is that the young generation would care more about beauty products. However, the insights drawn from this dataset tell otherwise. This insight will help immensely in ad targeting.
- If we talk in terms of age category, 45-55 years old contributed the highest no. of sales in Beauty, in clothing, 18-26 years old had the highest contribution and for electronics above 55 years old had the highest contribution.
- For beauty and clothing, females contributed the highest sales, while in electronics, males contributed the highest sales.
- About 82% of the customers bought products from all three categories.
- Across each product category, the highest no. of orders were placed in September, October, November and December. Therefore, seasonality exists for these products. This information may be used for strategising to increase sales, like providing additional discounts, special offers, vouchers, etc.
- 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM is the time interval when the highest no. of orders are placed. These insights may be used for floating time-targeted digital ads.

Other than the above, there are several other insights, like customers who order values are more than from given values and the average sales of that category. Such insights are very useful from a business perspective to increase sales and thus boost business growth.
